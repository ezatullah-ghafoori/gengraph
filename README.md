# GenGraph

GenGraph is a versatile utility designed to help visualize linear equations of the form \( ax + by = c \). This tool is ideal for students, educators, and anyone who needs to graphically represent linear equations quickly and easily.

## Features

- **Graphing Capability**: Visualizes linear equations with two variables.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple inputs for coefficients and constants.
- **Real-Time Graphing**: Immediate updates as you adjust the equation parameters.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and enhance the project under the MIT License.

## Prerequisites

Before running GenGraph, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or above. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Ensure itâ€™s up-to-date by running `npm install -g npm`.
